# Hotel-Booking-Demand-Analysis-
Python-based EDA of hotel booking datasets to explore demand patterns, cancellations, and revenue strategies. 
Hotel Booking Demand Analysis :

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of hotel booking demand using Python-based data analytics. It identifies the major factors influencing cancellations, seasonal demand shifts, customer behavior, and pricing strategies. The insights help hotels optimize revenue, reduce cancellations, and enhance customer satisfaction through data-driven decisions.

Project Objectives:

Understand what drives hotel booking cancellations

Analyze seasonal trends and demand cycles

Compare behaviors between City and Resort hotels

Study customer profiles and market segments

Examine pricing patterns and ADR (Average Daily Rate)

Recommend strategies for revenue and booking optimization

 Data Preparation & Cleaning:

The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed by:

Handling missing values

Removing duplicate records

Converting date fields

Encoding categorical variables

Normalizing numerical columns where needed

This ensured accurate and reliable analysis.

 Key Insights :
1️.Cancellation Analysis

Long lead time strongly correlates with cancellations

Higher prices (ADR) significantly increased cancellation likelihood

City hotels experienced more cancellations than resort hotels

Online bookings had higher cancellation rates than offline channels

2️.Seasonal Demand Trends

Peak demand months show increased booking density

Specific months (especially around January) showed unusually high cancellation rates

Seasonal surges in Resort hotels linked to holiday periods

3.Customer Behavior

Couples formed the majority of bookings

Families had longer stay durations

Repeat customers showed significantly lower cancellation rates

4️. Pricing Insights

City hotels generally had higher ADR

ADR spikes led to higher cancellations

Demand increased when prices were more stable across months

 Business Impact & Recommendations:
1. Pricing Strategy Optimization

Location-based dynamic pricing can reduce cancellations by up to 15%.

2.Targeted Seasonal Promotion

A 10% increase in the January marketing budget could raise revenue by ~25%.

3.Optimized Lead Time Policies

Introducing flexible cancellation policies for long lead-time bookings reduces booking losses.

4. Segment-Focused Offers

Tailored offers for families and repeat customers can improve retention.
